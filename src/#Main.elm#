{-  The CursorTree is a zipper with three dimensions, over a single type.
   By analogy, think of a cursor in a text editor, plus a hierarchy dimension,
   plus an ambiguity dimension.
   (TODO: add a history dimension? Or keep history per-item?)
   It is a **rosetree** with nested **windows**,
   and a single **pivot** for each layer,
   where you can manage **variant layers**, and either **choose** one or
   let the choice **undecided**. Each edge is **tagged* with an `a`.
   Variants are untagged. So paths can't single out variants.
   It is noteworthy that nodes don't carry data. Only edges contain instances of `a`.
   By convention, sequences surround the "down" edge, not the "up" edge.
   Such that a fold will converge a sequence with the down edge.

   These features are inspired by the list representation of a tree as drawn on paper,
   where the indentation represents nesting layer,
   font sizes (or outlines) represent hierarchical windows,
   names are the tags,
   successive identical names are variant forms.

   We get these features for free:
   - each node (as including its variants) has a unique path;
   - each node with a unique path can be visited through a zipper;
   - nodes you leave remember their pivot.

       locus                    --unique path to the current node
       focus        : Locus     --go there

   ## Hierarchy
   In the Parent/Kid dimension, you can insert hierarchical "windows".
   Applications include code folding, open/close nodes, outline hierarchy.

       up
       down

       add_window               --put kid in a window if kid exists.
       remove_window            --only possible if kid exists and is `inside`.

       window_depth    : Int    --returns 0 if no parent is `outside`.
       inside                   --the current tree with ancestry up to the first `outside` parent.

   ## Sequence

       before
       after


   ## Ambivalence
   You can make multiple sequences variant to each other. Once you have such an ambivalence,
   you can `choose` a preference.
   Important: you can only go into a node where you have chosen a preference. (This is why
   the `Up` type has no notion of undecided variant).

       left
       right
       choose                    --always chooses the first option
       unchoose                  --discards any beforeious choice

    ## TODO: Selection
    When you select text in a modern editor, you can hold down Shift and click on another
    character. If that character is outside of your selection range, the range will automatically
    be extended up to it. If it is inside, the closest limit of the range will be shrunk to
    exclude it. In our model, we have an additional 'midpoint', the current node, so we can
    will decide how to shrink based on that node. If it is 'beforeious' to the current node,
    the beforeious node will extend resp. shrink. This is trivially mapped to all dimensions.

    ## TODO: Multiselection
